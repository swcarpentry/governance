## Notes
**Action items are indicated with @.**

### State of the Matlab lesson
Sam: the Matlab part works, but needs testing on Octave. There is no nice explanation on indexing.
We briefly discuss whether this lesson could be sent back to the Carpentries Lab, but we decide to consider pulling lessons from the Lab to Software Carpentry instead (see below).

### Ideas for community discussions
- What kinds of things would people want to see as new lessons? First we need to come up with proposals.
- What is preventing instructors from participating more in lesson development?

### Outcome of the blog post
We find that there was substantially no response from the community.

### Status of workshops
Sam: there will be a five minute lightning talk at the Software Sustainability Institute Collaborations Workshop, presenting the new role of the LPGC.
The workshop on getting feedback on iteracting with us and our work was not accepted, it will be proposed for another event in September.
There's also CarpentryConnect in Heidelberg in November and Au-Nz CarpentryConnect in May. Valentina can try to give a lightning talk there too.

### Status of new maintainers recruitment
The Core teams seems to be pushing for it in various ways.

@Toby: please let us know if there's anything we can help with (e.g. the review of applications).

@Toby: could you please include the Matlab lesson in the recruitment process, if this hasn't been done?

### Lessons in the incubator etc.
We look at the [community-developed lessons](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons) and clarify between ourselves the difference
between CarpentriesLab and Carpentries Incubator. We look at stable lessons and possible candidates.
Currently stable and compatible with SWC: shell extra, good enough practices.
One topic for an extra SWC curriculum could be big data/parallel programming/cuda/ML, which would encompass several lessons currently in the Incubator.
We agree that this could both benefit SWC (showing the lesson program evolves and keeps to speed with the needs of the world) and could
encourage lesson developers with a clear objective of featuring as fully-official SWC lessons.

@Everyone: examine the beta lessons and consider which ones could be "encouraged" and then pulled.
Make a shortlist on lessons in the lab and think of possible combinations (a shared Excel sheet will be made available).

### Other
@Martino: Talk to David and Katherine about finally updating the git-dracula issue.

The date of the next meeting will be decided by Valentina and Menglan.
