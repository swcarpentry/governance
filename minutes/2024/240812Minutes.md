### Lessons in the Incubator and Carpentries Lab
We continue our discussion on lessons that we may want to suggest as main Software Carpentry lessons in the future, taken from the Carpentries Incubator and Lab.
There is [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BOsPnEQ-2TeKlRO6oopQ1xb6dcWY54hXe-X4yA6pUJ8/edit?usp=sharing) with some notes from all of us.
In particular we discuss:
- The [Good enough practices](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/good-enough-practices/) lesson, which appears ready in all respects.
- The [Intermediate Research Software Development](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) lesson, which contains many interesting things, but is currently still using the old lesson template.
We contacted Aleksandra Nenadic to encourage a transition to the Lab and to Workbench. Aleksandra replied that it has been submitted to the Lab already and a workshop at CarpentryConnect Heidelberg will be devoted to migrating to Workbench.
Toby is supporting the transition, asks if some LPGC members could assist as reviewers.

### Git lesson: updates
The update to the Git lesson is on the way. The main change is that we now use recipes instead of the Dracula/Wolfman story, but we also no longer use `git checkout`.
A [pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/pull/1003) is ready: the UCL people are on board, they and Toby reviewed it, the Spanish lesson maintainers have no objections, and the LPGC approves.

### Next meeting
The next meeting is tentatively scheduled on 30th September, but needs confirmation due to Martino's schedule for the term.
