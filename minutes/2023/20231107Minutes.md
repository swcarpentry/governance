# Minutes November 7th 2023

## Attendees
- Valentina Hurtado-McCormick
- Martino Sorbaro (Secretary)
- Samantha Ahern
- Toby Hodges (Carpentries director of curriculum)

## Agenda:
- Updates on previous agenda items

## Notes and Actions
- Discussion on maintainers: Some lessons did not respond to the request to update maintainers' names.
Martino moved to the git lesson; some maintainers across the community have been removed due to inactivity.
The SQL lesson only has one maintainer. The core team is working on recruiting more maintainers in general.
Toby will bring a summary on the state of maintainers next time.
- Website: no updates on pictures from the community. We have a discussion on looking for stock images
that could be related and more aesthetically pleasing. Martino will select a few and share them on the LPGC Slack channel.
- Maintenance and open issues: Valentina suggests that there could be a deadline after which stale issues are
closed, periodically, so that maintainers know when they have to do a periodic review. Toby: there is a
yearly review of the trainers' impact, and something similar could be applied to maintainers. The main issue is
to avoid the feeling of giving them too much pressure -- we need to do this in a way that is helpful rather than nagging them.
Sam: this could be very useful when we review the state of lessons.
- Possible lessons from the incubator: a list of candidate lessons is not yet available.
- Relationship to the CDC: Georgina is not responding. Toby will take care of this contact.
