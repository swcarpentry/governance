# Minutes November December 12th, 2023

## Attendees
- Valentina Hurtado-McCormick
- Martino Sorbaro (Secretary)
- Samantha Ahern
- Toby Hodges (Carpentries director of curriculum)

## Agenda:
- Changes to the Core Team
- Updates on previous agenda items

## Regarding Core Team layoffs
- Toby updates us on the layoffs in the Core Team. The remaining Core Team members will be less available
  to assist us, including Toby. In particular, CACs and the incubator will be less supported than now.
  The website refurbishment seems to be still planned despite Core Team changes.
- We discuss on the future of the LPGC in light of these changes. Toby illustrates two options:
  we can discontinue the LPGC for the moment, or continue its work but with less support from the Core Team.
  Toby supports the option of discontinuing it.
- LPGC members unanimously agree that they wish to continue working for the community, and state that the
  LPGC's job could be to support Core Team members rather than the other way around. Since the incubator will also
  be less supported and the git and python lessons require some coordination, Toby believes we could be of help
  in these two areas.
- It is not clear if the CAC is still willing to work. Toby will investigate. After the meeting, he has put us
  in touch with Menglan Xiang, a member of the CAC who is interested in continuing. She has been added to the
  LPGC mailing list and Slack. One possibility is to have a single committee instead of LPGC and CAC, as it used
  to be for Library Carpentry.

## Agenda for next meeting
- Further discuss how LPGC members see their future involvement, what form the LPGC and CAC may take,
and how to proceed in practice.
