## Notes and Actions
### Review of lessons
The LPGC members completed their review of the status of how the lessons are maintained. We find that all lessons listed in the
The software Carpentry homepage are actively maintained. These are some problems that should be considered:

- Several lessons have a mismatch between the list of maintainers in the lesson's Readme file and the SWC website.
Action: the LPGC members will open issues on the repos to get the maintainers' attention on this.

- Connected with the point above, Toby tells us that there is potentially a problem with the availability of maintainers for the Git lesson.
The curriculum team is working on finding more.

- The Matlab lesson has no maintainers. Actions: Martino will edit the website to advertise that we are looking for one.
Sam will review the lesson content to see if it's sufficiently up-to-date to remain on the website, or should be pushed back, say, to the incubator.
The relevance of the content and the presumed good status of the lesson must still be considered before making any further decisions - Toby's opinion is that it might be worth it to keep it as part of the SWC curriculum.

- Our main concern is that many lessons have a large number of open Github issues: more than a hundred in some cases, dating back to 2016.
This may give an impression of disregard and may discourage maintainers from keeping a clear idea of what needs to be done.
Toby says it is possible to install a tool that automatically closes inactive issues - a topic that has been discussed within the Core Team. The rest of the LPGC approves and encourages the  Core Team to look into it again.
Action: Toby will provide updates on this ongoing conversation as it evolves.

Additionally, we agree that we will soon discuss a way for lessons from the Incubator to be considered for the SWC official curriculum.
The discussion should also consider whether another section of the SWC curriculum (e.g., for more advanced or more specialized materials) should be opened.
As a start, Toby will provide us with a list of well-maintained Incubator lessons that could be candidates for the next audit.


At the end of the meeting, we tentatively chose the 31st of October for the next monthly catch-up (to be confirmed with Valentina, who left 15 minutes earlier). 
A note will be made in the follow-up email of potential changes to the time due to recent changes in the EU, UK, and Australia.
