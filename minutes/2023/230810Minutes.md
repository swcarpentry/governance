## Notes and actions
### Concluding PRs on Committee charter
The relevant PR has been merged.

### Concluding on phrasing of LPGC-CAC relationship
After a brief discussion, we decide to accept the current phrasing as shown in the minutes of the previous meeting.
*Action*: Martino will pass this on to the CAC for feedback/approval.

### Updates on website
- Martino's pull requests on the website, which archived the blog, removed the comments, and reorganized a few
more small things, have been accepted.
- Martino will put out a call for photos to add to the website.
Contributors will need to confirm that they got consent from people in photos for these to be used on websites.
Conferences and workshops sometimes have agreements that people can opt in/out of, which could be used.
- In terms of timeframe for the larger website overhaul, Toby reports that the Carpentries is still looking
for a collaborator, so this is not going to happen in the short term.

### Planning on lessons audit
We received an email from the Library Carpentry committee on how they did it. We decide to keep the same
overall strategy, except we identify a few issues:
- On the score describing the number of open issues/PRs, we shall keep raw numbers instead of a score scale at first,
since the amounts are quite different and not comparable to those of LC.
- The date of latest commit has been complicated by lesson transition: all lessons will have at least one commit from April/May
related to the infrastructure transition. when looking for most recent commit, if the most recent is from Zhian (zkamvar) relating to the tansition,
you should look past that in the project history, to find the last commit that was not Zhian doing transition stuff, or Toby adding/updating the zenodo.json file.

We split the lessons to be reviewed as follows:
- Sam: matlab; r-novice-inflammation; r-novice-gapminder; python-novice-gapminder
- Valentina: lessons in Spanish; sql
- Martino: shell-novice; git-novice; python-novice-inflammation; make

*Action*: Martino will create a spreadsheet to store the audit data.

Toby answers a few questions on lesson maintenance: all core lessons are actively maintained, but most non-core lessons are not,
e.g. MATLAB, Mercurial (or maybe this one is retired?). In his opinion, the "additional lessons" are good.
We discuss the relative role of the two Python lessons and find that they cater to different audiences with different aims.

## Not discussed
- Shall we create a process for Incubator lessons to be candidated to SWC?
- How can Carpentries support qualitative data analyses?
