# Minutes on the future of LPGC
LPGC members agree that one possibility is to join forces with the remaining CAC members and then take charge of both LPGC and CAC duties.
In that case, we could also take over certain jobs that the core team cannot support any more, like finding maintainers or auditing lessons.

Such a committee will:
- Approve major changes as written in the CAC consultation rubric contained in the Handbook
- Continue with former LPGC duties:  auditing of lessons, incubator lessons promotion, refreshing the curriculum, general governance
- Help the Core Team when needed, particularly on maintainer recruitment, or at least on checking where maintainers are needed.

Toby agrees that this could be a possibility and agrees with the idea, stating that we could be particularly helpful
in the area of curriculum update (new lessons, updates to the current lessons that require assistance, such as git).
He adds that there are also other members of the CAC that are occasionally active, but not as committed as Menglan.

All together, we agree that we will proceed as follows:
1. Contact Menglan, the active CAC member, and invite her to be part of our committee.
2. If Menglan agrees, reach out to the Board of Directors and notify them of our decision.
3. Tell the community through a blog post, which can include a call for volunteers on clearly defined projects, and by updating the Handbook.

# Other topics
Sam: in the Spring, there will be events in the UK and Germany where there can be hackatons.
These are good times for implementing larger changes in lessons. Sam can take care of helping that happen.

Updates on maintainer onboarding, from Toby: there will likely another one in June at the latest, but we'll try to start the process
in February because the need was exposed by the infrastructure update. The LPGC could help by reviewing applications.

# Action items
- Valentina: write to menglan after Martino makes minutes
- Sam: start thinking of the blog post

# Next meeting
The next meeting has not been scheduled, as we wait to see if it's possible to schedule one
together with Menglan.
