## Notes and actions

### Updates
Valentina and Martino worked a little on the website review. The [document](https://pad.carpentries.org/swc-lpgc-website-review)
has been updated with ideas an possible actions. Martino opened three pull requests that deal with some of the simpler issues.

Toby has published the [LPGC Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-governors.html) in the Docs.

### CAC-LPGC relationship
Georgina Pegu is the chair of the SWC CAC and joined us for this meeting. First, we had a Q&A on the role of the CAC.
In summary, we agreed on the exclusive and shared responsibilities as follows:
- The CAC has exclusive responsibility on the contents of individual lessons and the management of lesson materials.
- The LPGC has responsibility on broader policy and strategy matters, including the creation of new CACs for new curricula.
- The LPGC can request the CAC to consider changes in lessons, whenever there are policy reasons to do so.
- The CAC can escalate issues to the LPGC when appropriate, for example in case the CAC reaches an impasse, needs advice,
or would like assistance due to a high workload or other issues that prevent them from working effectively.
- For curriculum-level choices, namely retiring lessons or adding new lessons (e.g. from the Incubator), both the CAC and LPGC
can initiate the process, but shall not act without the consent of the other committee. The process shall also consider
the role of the maintainers of that lesson.

**Action**: The phrasing above is subject to the approval of these minutes. Upon approval, the LPGC will send them to the CAC for approval.
Then, this will be added to the Docs as a new rubric or as part of the existing CAC rubric.

We also decide to consult the Library Carpentry CAC for additional advice on how to deal with the relationship (LC
has had a LPGC-like committee for longer), and also on how to lead a review of the curriculum.
**Action**: Toby will put us in touch with the LC-CAC. We will try to ask questions by email first, and set up a meeting if needed.

### Next meeting
The next meeting is scheduled for Aug 10, 8am UTC. Martino will send out a new request for agenda items.
