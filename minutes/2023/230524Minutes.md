## Notes and Actions
### Introductions
The members introduced themselves and discussed the amount of time they can dedicate to Carpentries work.
There is a general agreement that the 8am UTC time, avoiding Tuesdays, is ideal for now (as long as summer time stands in Europe -- this may need to be reevaluated).
The Committee decides it will meet more often at the beginning, in order to set up its work. In particular, we schedule an additional meeting for next Wednesday.

### Communication
There is some disagreement on the use of email versus Slack. We agree that email will be used on important and organizational issues, while Slack will be used for extended discussion and asynchronous work.
*Action*: Toby will set the Topicbox mailing list to unmoderated for members.

### Decision making
Because the committee is only made of three members, we agree that decisions should be taken by agreement as much as possible,
and strong opposing opinions should be considered rather than dismissed by a majority vote.
1. The committee will pass motions by lazy consensus: if no member explicitly opposes the motion, the motion passes.
2. If members are absent when the motion is debated, or the motion is being debated asynchronously, members are notified of the motion and given a reasonable time frame to respond.
3. A time frame of a week is considered reasonable. This can be changed, depending on circumstances, as long as the absent member is notified and a reason is given.

*Action*: Toby will insert this in the committee Charter and submit it for review.

### Members term time and elections
We agree that the term time should align with that of the Executive council and of the CACs, two years.

We discussed the benefits and disadvantages of having elections for the LPGC as opposed to appointing members. In summary, elections are more complex to organize, will reasonably require consensus
with the other LPGCS and the Executive Council, and may select people who are less technically qualified, or put off people who are not happy to write a public statement.
On the other hand, elections would give mandate from the community, would distinguish the LPGC from the CAC, and expose the function of the LPGC to the community.

We conclude that we would prefer an elected LPGC, but we await the decisions of the other LPGCs, as it would be ideal to have the same strategy for admitting new members.

*Action*: Toby will let us know what the other LPGCs decide and, if there is a consensus, will contact the Executive committee to approve of elections.

The meeting concludes at 9.01 UTC with the aim of meeting again next Wednesday, 8.00 UTC.
