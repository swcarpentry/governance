## Notes

### LPGC powers & responsibilities
* Strategy, including guiding curriculum development
    * E.g. how should the lesson program develop, evolve, be strengthened and sustained?
    * LPGC has absorbed the responsibilities of the Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC), which makes it responsible for guiding the development of the curriculum.
* Advocacy
    * Represent Software Carpentry in your communities & networks, speak on its behalf at conferences, etc.
    * Advocate for the needs of the lesson program, to the Carpentries Board of Directors, Core Team, etc.
* Communications
    * The Core Team may reach out to you for help with website content updates and other communications related to Software Carpentry
    * The Core Team takes care of the day-to-day upkeep of SWC comms (website, social media, etc) -- contact Oscar Masinyana (Communications Manager) with requests to publish & update content.

### Summary of recent committee history & highlights of recent projects/discussions
See <https://github.com/swcarpentry/governance/tree/main/minutes> for minutes of previous meetings.
Some of the previous activities:

* Reviewed documentation
* Absorbed CAC
* Audited existing curriculum
* Advised on lesson updates
* Community outreach
* Audited lessons in the Incubator & Lab for potential adoption by SWC

* Community outreach: these efforts achieved limited success due to relatively low engagement with online discussions and untargeted feedback from participants.
* Auditing lessons:
    * onboarded Maintainers for the MATLAB lesson.
    * identified [Intermediate Research Software Development](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) curriculum as a good potential candidate for adoption.
    * [Building Better Research Software](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/better-research-software/) has also emerged recently (with [an R variant](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/better-research-software-r/) under development in the Incubator as well)
    * New members of this committee are among the developers/maintainers of all three of these lessons.
 
### Discussion of upcoming priorities
1. Review and potential adoption of new lessons/curricula, including those mentioned above. Toby can provide an overview of the current process for lesson peer review, and the steps taken by other lesson programs to adopt new lessons.
2. Draft a strategic plan for the lesson program: what do we want it to look like five years from now? Bring this to the community for feedback.
3. Build connections with the Maintainer community e.g. attend monthly Maintainer meetings, invite Maintainers to join LPGC meetings. Next cohort of Maintainers will be onboarded in March/April 2026.

### Next steps
1. Appoint a secretary and at least one chair for this committee.
    * Secretary takes minutes and uploads to GitHub repository linked above. Schedules meetings too, but Toby is going to try to do this for them in the coming weeks (see below)
    * Chair/Co-chairs: prepares agenda for meetings, sets meeting roles (if desired), coordinates/delegates work on action items outside meetings.
    * Please respond on the email thread or contact Toby directly if you would like to take on either role. (Sarah Stevens has since volunteered to chair/co-chair.)
2. Schedule next meetings.
    * The group attending the call were all generally available at 16:00 UTC on the third Tuesday of each month.
    * Toby will reach out to the absentee members to confirm their availability/poll for another day+time if necessary.

## Action items
- Toby to schedule next meeting(s).
- All committee members to consider whether they wish to take on role of secretary or (co-)chair, contact Toby if so.
- Toby to update list of Governors on <https://software-carpentry.org/about-us/governance/>

## Next meeting
Date & time to be confirmed.
